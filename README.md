**OCR and Document Search Web Application using Qwen2-VL 7B and ColPali Byaldi**

This project demonstrates an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Document Search web application using the Qwen2-VL 7B Instruct model for extracting text from images and performing keyword searches within the extracted text. The implementation leverages the ColPali Byaldi library for efficient vision-language tasks, and the web interface is powered by Gradio.

**Key Features**:
OCR Extraction: Extracts text from images using Qwen2-VL 7B Instruct.
Keyword Search: Allows users to search for specific keywords within the extracted text, with matching results highlighted.
Multi-language Support: Handles text extraction for both Hindi and English.
Web Interface: Simple, user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.

**Limitations**:
Performance: Since the Qwen2-VL 7B model is large, it may take some time to process images on CPU-based environments (such as Hugging Face Spaces free tier).
OCR Accuracy: The accuracy of the text extraction depends on the quality of the image and the content itself.
